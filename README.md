## How do I use it?

Rotation controls are embedded in all individual Dribbble shots. Click for 1Â° of rotation, or hold it down for continuous rotation.

Please note that only individual shots will have the rotation interface added. Degreee specifically looks for the following URI structure:

`*://dribbble.com/shots/*`
